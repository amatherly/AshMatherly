        <p>
            I have always been the type of person to master any subject I am interested in. The subjects I have mostly been interested in all share one thing in common - design. I absolutely thrive when tasked with iterative design. I value efficiency, functionality, and a positive user experience.
            My background in coffee roasting, sewing, and leatherwork taught me that prototyping, problem-solving, and iteration, along with user feedback, are the keys to developing a truly great product.
